<div class="para">For right now, we will assume that the observer is very very very far away from the object. This assumption means that moving left, right, up or down will not have any perceptible effect on what part of the object you are looking at. Think about looking up at the moon, if you move around, you donâ€™t start to see a new part of the moon. It looks the same, even if you went from Staten Island up to the Bronx, the moon would look the same. Programatically, this means that we can ignore any changes along the x or y axes.</div>
