<div class="para">The basic concept of Bresenham's Line Algorithm is to find potential pixels that we think would be good candidates for the line, test them, and then select the best one. To begin, we will start by restricting our line algorithm to only lines where <span class="process-math">\(0 \leq m \leq 1\text{,}\)</span> this will help narrow doent the possible pixels. Eventually, we can modify it to work for the other octants. We will also assume that our endpoints <span class="process-math">\((x_{0}, y_{0}), (x_{1}, y_{1})\)</span> only have integer coordinates. With those restrictions in place, if we are drawing a line as starting at <span class="process-math">\((x_{0}, y_{0})\text{,}\)</span> we only have 2 candidate pixels, <span class="process-math">\(A: (x_{0}+1, y_{0})\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(B: (x_{0}+1, y_{0}+1)\text{:}\)</span> <div class="image-box" style="width: 100%; margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%;"><img src="external/images/ch01-grid.jpg" class="contained" alt="A 9x5 grid with endpoints marked at (0, 0) and (9,3)"></div>
