<div class="para">Another way to think about this algorithm is to consider <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">d</code> as a variable that accumulates how off from the true line we have become. If we were always exactly on the line (this is the case for slopes 1, 0 and undefined), we’d be adding <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">0</code> to <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">d</code> each loop iteration. Given that we are starting with positive slopes less than 1, our loop is designed to always increase <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">x</code>, and occasionally, when <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">d</code> has accumulated too much error, we need to increase <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">y</code>. <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">A</code> is based off the change in <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">y</code>, which is always positive, <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">B</code> is the negation in the change in <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">x</code>, which is always negative. When <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">d</code> becomes negative overall, it means we’ve gone too far from the line, and need to make it positive by adding <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">A</code> and also increasing in <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">y</code>.</div>
