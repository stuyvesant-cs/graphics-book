<div class="para logical">
<div class="para">Our current parser is simplistic. It was great for what we were doing, but we need more flexibility in our image description files. Things that would be nice to have:</div>
<ul class="disc">
<li><div class="para">A way to define ambient light.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">A way to define point light sources.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">A way to create a set of reflection constants such that we can reuse them when we add objects without having to type out 9 values each time.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">A way to define a coordinate system totally independent of the current stack and use that when placing some objects (to give more control over our images).</div></li>
<li><div class="para">A looping structure to help with animation.</div></li>
</ul>
<div class="para">The last 3 things on the list above are really the sorts of things you would see in a more robust programming language. The last one being loops and the other 2 being essentially variables. So we are going to move from a simple parser to a compiler-style design. In order to do so, we have to know more about how compilers work.</div>
