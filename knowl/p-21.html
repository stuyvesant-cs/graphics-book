<div class="para logical">
<div class="para">There are a few options for maintaining edge lists. Consider the following image: <div class="image-box" style="width: 100%; margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%;"><img src="external/images/ch02-points.png" class="contained" alt="A triangle and square"></div> The triangle portion could be represented by any of the following edge lists:</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
\begin{bmatrix}P_{0} \amp P_{1} \amp P_{2}\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">Here, we would generate the image by iterating through the edge list 1 point at a time, connecting each point with the next one, and include a final line back to the initial point. This works well if the entire image was a single closed object, but less so for open ended or disjoint objects.</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
\begin{bmatrix}P_{0} \amp P_{1} \amp P_{2} \amp P_{0}\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">This is very similar to the first, execpt there’s no implicit connection from the last point to the first. This means we <em class="emphasis">could</em> have open ended shapes, but disjoint shapes, like the diamond, would not be as simple, since in this option, by adding <span class="process-math">\(P_{3}\)</span> we wouild get a line <span class="process-math">\(\overline{P_{0}P_{3}}\text{,}\)</span> which we don’t want.</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
\begin{bmatrix}P_{0} \amp P_{1} \amp P_{1} \amp P_{2} \amp P_{2} \amp P_{0}\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">In this version, we would generate the image by iterating over the list by pairs of points, drawing the lines between them. The advantage to this approach is that the list need not "know" anything about the image and what it contains. Every edge is explicitly defined. The downside is that there is a lot of duplication of points, but hey, memory’s cheap.</div>
