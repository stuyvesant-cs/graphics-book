<div class="para">This is specifically for reflection of a point light source. Specular reflection is the reflection of a specific light source in a specific direction (as oppsed to diffuse, which is reflected in all directions). Objects that display a lot of specular reflection often appear shinny or <em class="emphasis">glossy</em>. Things like polished metal and glass tend to exhibit a lot of specular reflection. This stems from the fact that glossy surfaces are very smooth. Since the reflection has a specific direction, specular reflection is dependent on the location of the object with respect to the point light source <em class="emphasis">and</em> the viewer. The more the viewer is in line with the reflected light, the strong the reflection will appear.</div>
