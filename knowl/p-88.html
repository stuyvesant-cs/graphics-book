<div class="para">So z is the important axis, since that determines if you are in front of or behind an object. Remember that z moves in a positive direction out from the screen towards the viewer, so <span class="process-math">\(\overrightarrow{V}\text{,}\)</span> the vector from the object to the viewer, should have a positive z component. For right now we can use <span class="process-math">\(\overrightarrow{V} = \lt 0, 0, 1&gt;\)</span> <aside class="aside aside-like"><div class="para">We will not be looking at changing <span class="process-math">\(\overrightarrow{V}\)</span> for now, but you can think about what that would mean for the rendered image and what effects that might lead to.</div></aside> for the following reasons:</div>
<ul class="disc">
<li><div class="para">We don't care about changes in x and y, so leaving them at 0 is fine.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">We need a positive z.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">By giving z the value of 1, the total mangnitude of <span class="process-math">\(\overrightarrow{V}\)</span> is 1. This is referred to as a <span class="process-math">\(normalized\)</span> vector.  It's not very important right now, but it will be later on, so we might as well start here.</div></li>
