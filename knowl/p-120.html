<div class="para">This is the general background lighting of an image. Imagine you were outside on a cloudy day, there would be a general amount of brightness to everything, but no one specific location that light was coming from. It is common to think about ambient light as if it is coming from all directions with equal intensity. This means that it doesnâ€™t matter where an object is located within the image, or where the viwer is with respect to the object.</div>
