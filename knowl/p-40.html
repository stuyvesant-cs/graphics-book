<div class="para">Remember that our purpose is to make a graphics engine, and <em class="emphasis">not</em> a graphing calcuator. So when thinking about drawing arbitrary polynomials, we have to think about what information is useful to us. Think about a circle, in order to draw one, we would like to know the center and radius. Turns out, that information not only describes the shape we’re drawing, but also goes directly into the parametric equations for making a circle. It is also easy to provide that information via a GUI (click center, drag for radius, boom). A standard 3rd degree polynomial, <span class="process-math">\(ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d\)</span> doesn’t trasnlate as easily into the graphical world. Think about drawing a line, we specify <em class="emphasis">endpoints</em> and generate the equation based on that. We will look at two types of splines, <em class="emphasis">Hermite</em> and <em class="emphasis">Bezier</em> curves, which are similar (in fact, you can translate between the two), but differ in the information required to generate a cruve.</div>
