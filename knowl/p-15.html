<div class="para logical">
<div class="para">Let's look at <span class="process-math">\(f\text{.}\)</span> We will use the standard form of a line:</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
f(x, y) = Ax + By + C
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">Where <span class="process-math">\(A = (y1-y0)\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(B = -(x1-x0)\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(C = b(y1-y0)\)</span> (here <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> is the y-intercept). Since we are assuming <span class="process-math">\(0 \leq m \leq 1\text{,}\)</span> and that our input coordinates are positive, then we know that <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> is also positive, and <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> is the only negative value in the function at all (ignoring <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span>). That tells us that if <span class="process-math">\(f(x, y)\)</span> is negative, then <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> is larger than it should be if <span class="process-math">\((x, y)\)</span> were on the line, meaning that <span class="process-math">\((x, y)\)</span> is <em class="emphasis">above</em> the line. Conversely, if <span class="process-math">\(f(x, y)\)</span> is positive, then <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> is smaller than it should be if <span class="process-math">\((x, y)\)</span> were on the line, meaning that <span class="process-math">\((x, y)\)</span> is <em class="emphasis">below</em> the line. So now we can say that:</div>
<ul class="disc">
<li><div class="para">If <span class="process-math">\((x+1, y+\dfrac{1}{2})\)</span> is negative the midpoint is above the line.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">If <span class="process-math">\((x+1, y+\dfrac{1}{2})\)</span> is positive the midpoint is below the line.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">If <span class="process-math">\((x+1, y+\dfrac{1}{2})\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span> the midpoint is on the line</div></li>
</ul>
<div class="para">This brings us to the next iteration of the algorithm:</div>
